We are making a cake named as RED VELVET CAKE.


 It  is a delicious cake.

 RED VELVET CAKE is made with cocoa powder, vinegar and buttermilk.

 The chemical reaction between these ingredients help give the cake a deep maroon color that is often enhanced by extra food coloring.

 RED VELVET CAKE has an acidic taste that comes from the use of buttermilk and vinegar as well as the cream cheese in the frosting. 

 The acidity is balanced out by the sweetness of the cake itself.

 It also has cocoa powder added to it for a mild chocolate flavoring.

 You can still find red velvet cake recipes today that call for beet juice.
